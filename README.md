# Irish Covidtracker statistics

This repository contains a set of in-app JSON statistics files containing
counts and other information about the Irish Covidtracker GAEN app.

The JSON files here are those downloaded each day as part of our
[TEK-transparency](https://github.com/sftcd/tek_transparency/) work.  The
specific files are from our first hourly run after midnight each day between
2020-10-08 and 2021-04-08 so represent six months of data.

There is also a [CSV file](ie-stats.csv) that is a slightly cleaned up version of the one
produced from those JSON files using this
[script](ie-stats.sh). 

We have published a short [report](https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/ie-stats.pdf)
describing this.
